            <p><span>Aaron</span>Born and raised as a well-oiled bike wheel, Aaron Bruce always dreamed he would fly; that one fateful day, he would take off, burning away his earthly ties, and sail high into that vivid, all-resplendent, golden horizon. On that day, he will realize his forthright design; his purpose; his all-consuming destiny. He will take up the memories of his friends, his family, his companions, his brother and sisters in arms and he will strap them to his back, so he will never fly too high above that splendid sky, lest he fall into the ever expanding void of the disillusion of space. Through his past, he will overcome, and re-imagine, and one day, return for the next episode of Adventure Time Mondays through Fridays at 7:00 PM central, only on Cartoon Network. ...and Pom.</p>

            <p><span>Isaiah</span>Isaiah is a creature from earth. He identifies as human/other. He enjoys eating food, sleeping from time to time(on a daily basis...sometimes), and living life. Isaiah emerged into this realm roughly 27years ago with the intent to do things. Be aware that when approaching Isaiah, he may seem distracted or spaced out. This is normal, he is just trying to figure out what he will be eating later that day.</p>
